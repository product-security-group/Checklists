# Checklists

## Introduction

[**Product Security Group**](https://www.productsecuritygroup.com) (PSG) offers Checklists; a collection of documents to impart our knowledge and experience in the security and privacy disciplines.

## Why

Well, in our journey through the security and privacy we have curated a lot of information and we felt it was important to share this with folks where we can. They are by no means complete but they are a good start for folks that need some guidance.

## Blog/Webinar Series 

Look for a drops here as we put more information out on the checklists we release.


## Contributing
PSG anticipates, with collaboration throughout the security & privacy field, to add more specific information in each checklist as things change/evolve.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
